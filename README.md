Project Documentation: Vahan Bazar – Two-Wheeler Marketplace Web App
Abstract

The project “Vahan Bazar” focuses on developing a two-wheeler marketplace web application that enables users to browse, compare, and purchase bikes, scooters, and EVs. The application will feature advanced search and filtering, detailed specifications with images, EMI and fuel cost calculators, upcoming launches, and showroom exploration. It will also support booking test rides and selling used bikes. By digitizing the dealership and resale ecosystem, Vahan Bazar aims to make vehicle transactions seamless, transparent, and efficient.
